    - list the existing Gophers
    - display the information about a Gopher
    - create a new Gopher
    - delete a Gopher
    - update the path and the URL of a Gopher`,

	// has an action associated with it:
	// Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) { },
}

// Execute adds all child commands to the root command and sets flags appropriately.
// This is called by main.main(). It only needs to happen once to the rootCmd.
